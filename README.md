# Clear Skies

A weather applet in the form of a Chrome extension. Porting to Firefox is trivial, and requires only minor edits to the manifest.

This app displays current temperature, wind speed, and humidity, as well as an hourly and daily forecast based on data from the geolocation and weather.gov APIs. It also includes settings for metric and imperial units, as well as the typical custom css provided with custom-NTP.
